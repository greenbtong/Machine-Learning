    "So far in our classes we have focussed mainly on regression problems, which are examples of supervised learning. We have considered the relationship between the likelihood and the objective function and we have shown how we can find paramters by maximizing the likelihood (equivalent to minimizing the objective function) and in the last session we saw how we can *marginalize* the parameters in a process known as Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to turn to a different form of learning, commonly known as *unsupervised* learning. In unsupervised learning our data isn't necessarily labelled in any form, but we want models that give us a better understanding of the data. We've actually seen an example of this already with *matrix factorization* for collaborative filtering, which we introduces in the context of *objective functions*. Now we will introduce a more probabilistic approach to such models, specifically we are interested in *latent variable* modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latent Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent means hidden, and hidden variables are simply *unobservable* variables. The idea of a latent variable is crucial to the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning and experimental design. A latent variable could take many forms. We might observe a man walking along a road with a large bag of clothes and we might *infer* that the man is walking to the laundrette. Our observations are a highly complex data space, the response in our eyes is processed through our visual cortex, the combination of the indidivuals limb movememnts and the direction they are walking in all conflate in our heads to cause us to infer that (perhaps) the individual is going to the laundrette. We don't *know* that the man is walking to the laundrette, but we have a model of the world that suggests that it's a likely outcome for the very complex data. In some ways the latent variable can be seen as a *compression* of this very complex scene. If I were writing a book, I might write that \"A man tripped over whilst walking to the laundrette\". In the reader's mind an image of a man, perhaps laden with dirty clothes, may occur. All these ideas come from our expectations of the world around us. We can make further inference about the man, some of it perhaps plausible others less so. The man may be going to the laundrette because his washing machine is broken, or because he doesn't have a large enough flat to have a washing machine, or because he's carrying a duvet, or because he doesn't like ironing. All of these may *increase* in probability given our observation, but they are still *latent* variables. Unless we follow the man back to his appartment, or start making other enquirires about the man, we don't know the true answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear that to do inference about any complex system we *must* include latent variables. Latent variables are extremely powerful. In robotics, they are used to represent the *state* of the robot. The state of the robot may include its position (in x, y coordinates) its speed, its direction of facing. How are *these* variables unknown to the robot? Well the robot only posesses *sensors*, it can make observations of the nearest object in a certain direction, and it may have a map of its environment. If we represent the state of the robot as its position on a map, it may be uncertain of that position. If you go walking or running in the hills around Sheffield, you can take a very high quality ordnance survey map with you. However, unless you are a really excellent orienteer, when you are far from any given landmark, you will probably be *uncertain* about your true position on the map. These states are also latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis of experiments you try to control for each aspect of the experiment, in particular by *randomization*. So if I'm interested in the ability of a particular fertilizer to improve the yield of a particular plant I may design an experiment where I apply the fertilizer to some plants (the treatment group) and withold the fertilizer from others (the control group). I then test to see whether the yield from the treatment group is better (or worse) than the control group. I may find that I have an excellent yield for the treatment group. However, what if I'd (unknowlingly) planted all my treatment plants in a sunny part of the field, and all the control plants in a shady part of the field. That would also be a latent variable, in this case known as a *confounder*. In statistical experimental design *randomization* is used to attempt to eliminate the correlated effects of these confounders: you aim to ensure that if these confounders *do* exist their effects are not correlated with treatment and contorl. This is known as a [randomized control trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial).\n",
    "\n",
    "Greek philosophers worried a great deal about what was knowable and what was unknowable. Adherents of [philosophical skeptisism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism) were inspired by the idea that since your senses sometimes give you contradictory information, they cannot be trusted, and in extreme cases they chose to *ignore* their senses. This is an acknowledgement that very often the true state of the world cannot be known with precision. Unfortunately, these philosophers didn't have a good understanding of probability, so they were unable to encapsulate their ideas through a *degree* of belief.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often use language to express the compression of a complex behavior or patterns in a simpler way, for example we talk about motives as a useful distallation for a perhaps very complex patter of behavior. In physics we use principles of causation and simple laws to describe the world around us. Such motives or underlying principles are difficult to observe directly, our conclusions about them emerge over a period of time by observing indirect consequences of the latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epistemic uncertainty allows us to deal with these worries by associating our degree of belief about the state of the world with a probaiblity distribution. This core idea underpins state space modelling, probabilistic graphical models and the wider field of latent variable modelling. In this session we are going to explore the idea in a simple linear system and see how it relates to *factor analysis* and *principal component analysis*."

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the 20th century there was a great deal of interest amoungst psychologists in formalizing patterns of thought. The approach they used became known as factor analysis. The principle is that we observe a potentially high dimensional vector of characteristics about an individual. To formalize this, social scientists designed questionaires. We can envisage many questions that we may ask, but the assumption is that underlying these questions there are only a few traits that dictate the behavior. These models are known as latent trait models and the analysis is sometimes known as factor analysis. The idea is that there are a few characteristic traits that we are looking to discern. These traits or factors can be extracted by assimilating the high dimensional characteristics of the individual into a few latent factors.\n",

    "In 1933 [Harold Hotelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hotelling) published on *principal component analysis* the first mention of this approach. Hotelling's inspiration was to provide mathematical foundation for factor analysis methods that were by then widely used within psychology and the social sciences. His model was a factor analysis model, but he considered the noiseless 'limit' of the model. In other words he took $\\sigma^2_i \\rightarrow 0$ so that he had\n",

    "$$\n",
    "The paper had two unfortunate effects. Firstly, the resulting model is no longer valid probablistically, because the covariance of this Gaussian is 'degenerate'. Because $\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top$ has rank of at most $q$ where $q<p$ (due to the dimensionality reduction) the determinant of the covariance is zero, meaning the inverse doesn't exist so the density,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "is *not* valid for $q<p$ (where $\\mathbf{W}\\in\\Re^{p\\times q}$). This mathematical consequence is a probability density which has no 'support' in large regions of the space for $\\mathbf{y}_{i,:}$. There are regions for which the probability of $\\mathbf{y}_{i,:}$ is zero. These are any regions that lie off the hyperplane defined by mapping from $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\mathbf{y}$ with the matrix $\\mathbf{W}$. In factor analysis the noise corruption, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, allows for points to be found away from the hyperplane. In Hotelling's PCA the noise variance is zero, so there is only support for points that fall precisely on the hyperplane. Secondly, Hotelling explicity chose to rename factor analysis as principal component analysis, arguing that the factors social scientist sought were different in nature to the concept of a mathematical factor. This was unfortunate because the factor loadings, $\\mathbf{W}$ can also be seen as factors in the mathematical sense because the model Hotelling defined is a Gaussian model with covariance given by $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top$ so $\\mathbf{W}$ is a *factor* of the covariance in the mathematical sense, as well as a factor loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the paper had one great advantage over standard approaches to factor analysis. Despite the fact that the model was a special case that is subsumed by the more general approach of factor analysis it is this special case that leads to a particular algorithm, namely that the factor loadings (or principal components as Hotelling referred to them) are given by an *eigenvalue decomposition* of the empirical covariance matrix."

    "### Relationship to Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the robot naviation example to realise that PCA (and factor analysis) are very reminiscient of the *matrix factorization* example that we used for introducing objective functions. In that system we used slightly different notation, $\\mathbf{u}_{i,:}$ for *user* location in our metaphorical library and $\\mathbf{v}_{j,:}$ for *item* location in our metaphorical library. To see how these systems are somewhat analagous, now let us think about the user as the robot and the items as the wifi access points. We can plot the relative location of both. This process is known as \"SLAM\": simultaneous *localisation* and *mapping*. A latent variable model of the type we have developed is one way of performing SLAM. We have an estimate of the *landmarks* in the system (in this case WIFI access points) and we have an estimate of the robot position. These are analagous to the estimate of the user's position and the estimate of the items positions in the library. In the matrix factorisation example users are informing us what items they are 'close' to by expressing their preferences, in the robot localization example the robot is informing us what access point it is close to by measuring signal strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a personal perspective, I find this analogy quite comforting. I think it is very arguable that one of the mechanisms through which we (as humans) may have developed higher reasoning is through the need to navigate around our environment, identifying landmarks and associating them with our search for food. If such a system were to exist, the idea that it could be readily adapted to other domains such as categorising the nature of the different foodstuffs we were able to forage is intriguing.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an algorithmic perspective, we also can now realise that matrix factorization and latent variable modelling are effectively the same thing. The only difference is the objective function and our probabilistic (or lack of probabilistic) treatment of the variables. But the prediction functoin for both systems,\n",

    "### Other Interpretations of PCA: Separating Model and Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Hotelling first introduced his perspective on factor analysis as PCA there has been somewhat of a conflation of the idea of the model underlying PCA (for which it was very clear that Hotelling was inspired by Factor Analysis) and the algorithm that is used to fit that model: the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors of an ellipsoid have been known since the middle of the 19th century as the principal axes of the elipsoid, and they arise through the following additional ideas: seeking the orthogonal directions of *maximum variance* in a dataset. Pearson in 1901 arrived at the same algorithm driven by a desire to seek a *symmetric regression* between two covariate/response variables $x$ and $y$. He is, therefore, often credited with the invention of principal component analysis, but to me this seems disengenous. His aim was very different from Hotellings, it was just happened that the optimal solution for his model was coincident with that of Hotelling. The approach is also known as the [Karhunen Loeve Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve_theorem) in stochastic process theory and in classical multidimensional scaling the same operation can be shown to be minimising a particular objective function based on interpoint distances in the data and the latent space (see the section on Classical Multidimensional Scaling in [Mardia, Kent and Bibby](http://store.elsevier.com/Multivariate-Analysis/Kanti-Mardia/isbn-9780124712522/)). One of my own contributions to machine learning was deriving yet another model whose linear variant was solved by finding the principal subspace of the covariance matrix (an approach I termed dual probabilistic PCA or probabilistic principal coordinate analysis). Finally, the approach is sometimes referred to simply as singular value decomposition (SVD). The singular value decomposition of a data set has the following form,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{V} \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{U}^\\top\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}^2$ is now the eigenvalues of the covariane matrix and $\\mathbf{U}$ are the eigenvectors. So performing the SVD can simply be seen as another approach to determining the principal components."

    "### Separating Model and Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "I've given a fair amount of personal thought to this situation and my own opinion that this confusion about method arises because of a conflation of model and algorithm. The model of Hotelling, that which he termed principal component analysis, was really a variant of factor analysis, and it was unfortunate that he chose to rename it. However, the algorithm he derived was a very convenient way of optimising a (simplified) factor analysis, and it's therefore become very popular. The algorithm is also the optimal solution for many other models of the data, even some which might seem initally to be unrelated (e.g. seeking directions of maximum variance). It is only through the mathematics of this linear system (which also contains some intersting symmetries) that all these ides become related. However, as soon as we choose to non-linearise the system (e.g. through basis functions) we find that each of the non-linear intepretations we can derive for the different models each leads to a very different algorithm (if such an algorithm is possible). For example [principal curves](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/Principal_Curves.pdf) of Hastie and Stuezle attempt to non-linearise the maximum variance interpretation, [kernel PCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_principal_component_analysis) of Schoelkopf, Smola and Mueller uses basis functions to form the eigenvalue problem in a nonlinear space, and my own work in this area [non-linearises the dual probabilistic PCA](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume6/lawrence05a/lawrence05a.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "My conclusion is that when you are doing machine learning you should always have it clear in your mind what your *model* is and what your *algorithm* is. You can recognise your model because it normally contains a prediction function and an objective function. The algorithm on the other hand is the sequence of steps you implement on the computer to solve for the parameters of this model. For efficient implementation, we often modify our model to allow for faster algorithms, and this is a perfectly valid pragmatist's approach, so conflation of model and algorithm is not always a bad thing. But for clarity of thinking and understanding it is necessary to maintain the separation and to maintain a handle on when and why we perform the conflation."

    "### PCA in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis is so effective in practice that there has almost developed a mini-industry in renaming the method itself (which is ironic, given its origin). In particular [Latent Semantic Indexing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing) in text processing is simply PCA on a particular representation of the term frequencies of the document. There is a particular fad to rename the eigenvectors after the nature of the data you are examining, perhaps initially triggered by [Turk and Pentland's](http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/PCA/jcn.pdf) paper on eigenfaces, but also with [eigenvoices](https://wiki.inf.ed.ac.uk/twiki/pub/CSTR/ListenSemester1_2007_8/kuhn-junqua-eigenvoice-icslp1998.pdf) and [eigengenes](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/54). This seems to be an instantiation of a wider, and hopefully subconcious, tendency in academia to attempt to differentiate one idea from the same idea in related fields in order to emphasise the novelty. The unfortunate result is somewhat of a confusing literature for relatively simple model. My recommendations would be as follows. If you have multivariate data, applying some form of principal component would seem to be a very good idea as a first step. Even if you intend to later perform classification or regression on your data, it can give you understanding of the structure of the underlying data and help you to develop your intuitions about the nature of your data. Intelligent plotting and interaction with your data is always a good think, and for high dimensional data that means that you need some way of visualisation, PCA is typically a good starting point."
